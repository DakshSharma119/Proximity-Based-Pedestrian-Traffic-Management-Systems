Proximity-Based Pedestrian Traffic Management Systems aim to improve safety, reduce congestion, and enhance accessibility for all pedestrians, including those who are visually impaired and face challenges in navigating through crowded areas. By providing audible cues, tactile feedback, and accessible routes, these systems can help ensure the safety and efficiency of pedestrian traffic. Additionally, the systems can optimize resource allocation and provide real-time information to stakeholders to improve the overall user experience.
